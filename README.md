Farming will be very challenging in near future due to climate changes, industrialization and
population increase. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the world will
need to produce 70% more food in 2050 than it did in 2006 in order to feed the growing
population of the Earth. Smart farming or precision agriculture is emerging to meet this
demands by providing the farmers with decision-making support to increase production
capabilities and reduce costs.

Smart farming requires collection of data from various sources including sensors, global
positioning systems, communication systems, social networks apis, weather data … , big data
storage and analysis. A major challenge in precision agriculture today is how to analyze these
data efficiently and use them to improve farming decisions.
The IDEAC project aims to help farmers to make precise and predictive decisions for maximum productivity, greater profits and more
sustainability.

An open source architecture have been proposed to address the different challenges
(heterogeneous data collection (sensors, server apis, social networks….), big data storage and
data analytics…).
